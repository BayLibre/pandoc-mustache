# Contributing to pandoc-mustache

[![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

This code is not being actively developed. It was created to fulfill my pandoc writing needs, and the current feature set is adequate for me.

If you have a **bug report**, you can create an issue or file a pull request. I'll look into it, time permitting.

If you have a **feature request**, it is unlikely that I will be able to implement it for you. You can create an issue to generate discussion. If you implement a feature, you can file pull request and I will review it eventually, as time permits. If you're interested in making major additions to the code, I'd be happy to welcome a new maintainer to the project.
